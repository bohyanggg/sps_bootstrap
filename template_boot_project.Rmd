# Introduction

General explanation of the project with your own words. Include also a description of the type of bootstrap intervals that will be presented and a discussion of computational issues including code chunks with the functions that are specifically written to answer the questions (alternatively, present the code in an Appendix).

# Results

## CIs on the regression coefficientes for the initial model 

## Backward elimination procedure

## CIs on the regression coefficientes for the final model

##  CI(s) on the mean response
