# About

Bootstrap project for the course Simulation in Probability and Statistics, imparted by Universidad Carlos III de Madrid in Spring 2024.  
Built by Hsieh Boh Yang and Emmanuel Mathew Thomas.

## Tasks

> Build a robust linear regression model with the three covariates and use (95%) bootstrap confidence intervals on the regressorsâ€™ coefficients to study their significance.
>
>  Use backward elimination to select the relevant covariates and provide the chosen regression model. Start with the three covariates and delete the ones that do not contribute significantly to the model (as suggested by the bootstrap confindence intervals) until all remaining covariates contribute significantly to the regression model.
>
> Provide 95% confidence intervals on the regression coefficients of the chosen model inthe previous part.
>
> Build a 95% confidence interval on the mean response when (x1, x2, x3) = (14, 14, 14).
